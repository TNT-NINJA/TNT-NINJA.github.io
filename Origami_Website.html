            <!-- First paragraph: explanation of what origami is -->
            <p>
                What is origami?  Origami is traditionaly the art of folding a square of paper into various shapes and animals. 
                These can range from simple cranes all the way to incredibly complex insects.

                Some people may only think of origami as folding paper into animals, but there are many different branches of origami,
                such as creating geometrical shapes and figures like this.

            <!-- Second paragraph: origins of origami -->
            <p>
                The origins of origami aren't known for certain, but most people
                believe that origami originated in Japan. Early on, paper was expensive to 
                make so origami was largely restricted to the upper-class and for ceremonies.
                In the 1600s, the price of producing paper was greatly reduced, which caused 
                origami to spread to the rest of the population. In 1853, Japan's policy
                of commercial and cultural isolation from of the rest of the world ended.
                This opened origami to the rest of the world where instructional books for
                children on basic folds spread it to across the globe.

           <p>
               Origami isn't just an art form, it also has practical applications. Many of the techniques
               used in origami can also be applied to engineering problems.

                <li>For example, engineers have used origami origami principles to create a solar panel 
                    that folds up to a small size, but can be unfolded to a very large size. They are 
                    hoping to use this model in space where the solar panels can be sent up in a rocket
                    compacted, and then expand with little astronaut assistance. Here are images of the model 
                    compacted and fully expanded. <br>

                    <br></li>
                <li>Origami has also been used in marine biology. Robert Lang from Harvard University developed 
                    an origami inspired machine that can function under water. Its purpose is to collect soft 
                    bodied underwater creatures such as sponges and seaslugs without harming them. The machine 
                    is fully functional underwater, can easily capture underwater creatures, and can be made
                    with a 3-d printer in mere hours. <br> </li>

                <li>Origami has also been used in the design of airbags in cars. Concepts from traditional origami 
                    have been used in order fold air bags into a small space in a way where they can both expand very 
                    rapidly and once expanded be strong enough to safely  cushion a person in the event of a crash.<br></li>

                <li>The field of medicine has also been improved by origami. A PhD student at MIT named Katerina 
                    Mantzavinou has worked on an
                    application of origami to possibly treat cancer. it works through a capsule that carries drugs 
                    to a cancererous tumor and folds up small. Once it has reached the desired target it unfurls and
                    realeases the drug to fight the tumor. The design hasn't been finished yet and she is is still
                    working on making it small enough to reach the desired destination.<br>

            </ul>

                These are a few of the many uses for origami in engineering and science. Origami can be an invaluable 
                resource when solving problems. If you would like to learn more about how origami has evolved from simply
                an artform to a science,
